        <h2>Problem/Challenge </h2>
            <p>The problem we decided to tackle was the issue of safety in busy intersections. How can we leverage current existing technology and design to create a safer environment for drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists.

            <p>To gain a better understanding of current safety issues in intersections, we specifically looked at a few intersections in the city of San Diego labeled as the Fatal Fifteen. These fifteen intersections had the highest rates of accidents. By looking at the most dangerous intersections, we were able to more easily identify problems within the intersection and the causes for the high number of accidents.</p>

        <h2>Interviews</h2>
        <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p>Through our interviews and observations at some of the Fatal Fifteen intersections, we were able to gain a few key insights about the problem. Among some of the problems we noticed in the intersection was the “busyness” of the intersection. Beyond the large number of cars, cyclists, and pedestrians, we saw firsthand how multiple modalities of travel were competing with one another. Buses, cyclists, cars turning left, cars dropping passengers off, garbage trucks, and car parking were all vying for space on the outside lanes closest to the street. In addition, we saw that in order for cars to enter parking lot entrances, they had to make 3-4 lane changes and the tight space of the intersection meant that cars often turning left on the intersection would cut almost vertically across the lanes to enter the parking lot. 
            </p>
            <p>A few key insights we gained from interviews were that new drivers or drivers in an unfamiliar area are forced to process information from signs, nearby cars, and navigation systems and can often experience a “cognitive overload” where the sheer number of elements that drivers are expected to observe and react to are unreasonable. In addition, each stakeholder in the intersection has different priorities. A pedestrian crossing the street may be concerned with reaching their destination and crossing the street safely. However, a driver in that same intersection might have the priority of getting to work on time and not have pedestrian or cyclist safety at the forefront of their thoughts.

    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <p>During our concept generation process, we were focused on increasing safety for all stakeholders in the intersection. Since we found cars to be one of the most prevalent stakeholders within the intersection, we focused a lot of our concepts on cars.</p>
        <p>Some of our concepts included dividing the intersection into multiple layers and having stakeholders navigate through the intersection on multiple “levels” as to avoid any possibility of collisions from different stakeholders (i.e. cars, pedestrians, and cyclists). In the same way a multistory building increases the amount of available space, so too would dividing the intersection into multiple layers increase the amount of effective intersection space and create degrees of separation from different stakeholders with the option of further dividing those stakeholders based on direction.</p>
        <p>We also were interested in how we could physically stop cars from hitting pedestrians and cyclists. Obviously this idea wasn't feasible, so we looked into how we could metaphorically stop drivers from hitting pedestrians and cyclists.

        <h2>Low-Fidelity Prototype</h2>
        <p>One focus we had during our second round of concept generation was leveraging existing technology to generate a realistic solution to our problem that could be implemented by the city at a relatively low cost. This thought inspired us to examine current innovations within the San Diego area with regards to transportation. We learned that San Diego was rolling out Smart Street Lights which were street lights with many sensors installed including a camera. We realized we could utilize machine learning and computer vision to recognize objects within the intersection. These Smart Street Lights can recognize and track objects such as cars and pedestrians and alert drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists of potential collisions and accidents by tracking their positional and directional data. </p>
        <p>To deliver this information to primarily drivers, we decided that the best way to communicate this information to drivers would be through a heads-up display on the windshield. By ensuring that the display was overlaid onto the windshield and semi-transparent, we would 1. enable drivers to keep their eyes on the road and not look down or away, 2. allow the driver to decide what to focus on. By presenting the display on the windshield, we place the display in plain sight while remaining out of mind when unneeded.</p>

            <h2>Feedback</h2>
            <p>From feedback received from judges of the D4SD competition, we learned that they thought that the heads-up display would be distracting to drivers, further contributing to the cognitive overload experienced by drivers. The second point made by the judges was that our idea may be unfeasible and that the information, when displayed on the heads-up display, may not be presented in time for the driver to alter their course before a collision.</p> 
            <p>In response to the first critique, we wanted to study distractions that driver’s currently experience such as having Google Maps loaded on their phone and having to continually look for pedestrians, cars, and cyclists in addition to street signs. By comparing a prototype of our solution of a heads-up display to alternatives, we would be able to gauge how much more or less distracting our solution would be to drivers. We would measure variables such as how many times a driver took his or her eyes off the road to look at either their phone or at signs on the roads and the corresponding duration. </p>
            <p>In response to the second critique, we believe that our idea is implementable. By utilizing wireless communication technology such as Bluetooth, NFC, Wi-Fi, or any other wireless signal, these Smart Street Lights could transmit data to a data center where machine learning and computer vision algorithms are run on that data and then sent to various cars to provide them with contextual information. Self-driving car software exists and is currently being iterated on by companies such as Tesla, Waymo, and Uber and this technology could be leveraged to help process that intersection data. The software would need to be predictive and not reactive in order to provide drivers ample time to alter their course and avoid an accident or collision. One challenge we recognize in implementing our idea is putting together a team of developers who can create a network to transfer the data from San Diego’s Smart Streetlights to a data center to be processed and then sent back to cars within the intersection. </p>

    <h2>User Testing</h2>
    <p>
        We tested our design by "WOZing" our prototype with drivers. We first looked at how distracted drivers were using google maps, and then tested the effectiveness of a device that would highlight important objects in the street.
    </p>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-12">

            <br>
            <p>
                We held a phone at the front and side of the car to capture different angles. We then skyped this screen to another phone and drew over objects that we viewed as a potential threat to safety, such as another car or pedestrian. We also tried to use auditory cues such as a beeping noise if a driver was in danger.
            </p>
            <p>
                We gathered important key insights from this user testing. People rarely looked at our video, choosing to keep their eyes on the road. Beeping noises are also distracting and don't tell the driver what object to look out for, such as a pedestrian or driver. Even while using google maps, users rarely looked at the map or directions and mainly relied on the auditory information. Finally, alerts should be contextual, and not identify all objects, only potential threats.
            </p>

    <h2>Final Prototype</h2>
    <p>
        We decided to model our solution after google maps. The app would provide video footage of what was happening in the road if users wanted to glance at it, but not require them to always look at the interface for warnings. Our app would use auditory alerts by actually saying statements such as "watch out for the pedestrian". Additionally, the app will only alert drivers during dangerous situations. For example if the car was stopped while a pedestrian was crossing the street, there would not be an alert. The app would only warn the driver if the car started moving.
